      <h2>Solar Electricity</h2>

      <h3>How do Solar Panels work?</h3>

        <p>
          Solar panels operate on the principal, that black surfaces attract heat from the sun. Just like the roof of a black car on a sunny day. The heat is generated in the solar panel, and
          must be transferred to the hot water cylinder, where it can be used. It is transferred from the panel, to the cylinder with the use of a small pump and insulated pipework.<br><br>

          The pumps we use are low noise and low energy consumption. The pipe comes already insulated from the factory. When the heat reaches the hot water cylinder, we send it through a heat exchanger
          inside the cylinder. This causes the water inside to heat up, without costing you any money.<br><br>

          There are two different types of solar panels on the market. Read below for info on these.

      <h2>Solar Hot Water</h2>

      <h3>What type of Solar Panels should I choose?</h3>

        <p><strong>There are two types of solar collectors available. Evacuated tube and flat plate panels.</strong><br><br>

                    Evacuated tube solar panels offer higher efficiencies as they have little to no heat loss. Evacuated tube solar panels out perform flat panels in
                    cloudy or cooler climates. Flat plate panels have high thermal losses (as in, they lose heat to the outside air). Whereas, evacuated tubes are like thermos flasks and don't lose
                    any heat. In addition, because the tube is round, it always has the maximum possible area facing the sun. As a result, evacuated tube panels
                    are on average 20% more efficient than flat plate panels in Ireland. Here is the proof.
        </p>


        <p><strong>Flat plate or tubes</strong><br><br>

                    Flat plate panels on the other hand, expose their full face area for a short period of time when the sun is directly overhead. This is
                    because they are, as their name suggests, flat.
                    So when the sun is overhead, they work well, but by 4pm in the afternoon when the sun is facing the side of the flat surface, it produce less energy.
                    When comparing panels, make sure not
                    to only compare "peak output" and to compare the output over the entire day. The two types of solar panels may take in the exact same amount of energy,
                    but the flat panel will lose some of
                    it's energy to the air, before it's able to transfer it to the water. On a sunny day, this doesn't matter, as the panel will lose heat, but
                    it will be replaced immediately by the sun. On an
                    average Irish day, it really does matter as the air temperature might be 10c so the panel at 70 c will lose lots of heat to the outside air.

                    The south polar base station heats it water by solar panels. They use Kingspan
                    Thermomax evacuated tubes, as flat plates don't work well in cooler, less sunny climates. We recently
                    installed solar panels for Siemens Diagnostics in Swords. These guys did their homework and decided on
                    Kingspan Thermomax solar panels. NASA installed Kingspan Thermomax panels a few years ago.
                    The Pentagon, UCD, Siemens and St. James Hospital to name but a few, all have Kingspan Thermomax panels
                    installed on their premises. Those clients do their research and purchase the panels
                    that will give them the best performance, without compromise. We actually installed the system for Siemens Ireland in 2011.

                    We install high spec Kingspan solar panels.

                    Kingspan Thermomax solar panels - Highest efficiencies, overheat protection, longest warranty in the world, Solar Keymark certification, aesthetically pleasing and made locally
